# Unity-Fun-2D-Dungeon-Game
I made this game in Summer of 2019 for fun in a couple of hours. 

Only thing needed beyond what I have on here, is I used the TextMesh Pro Pack from the Unity Asset store for UI purposes.
I didn't want to just steal it and place it on my github, so you'll need to find it at https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126.

Besides that have fun!
